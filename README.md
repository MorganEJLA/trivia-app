Trivia app using an API and Vanilla Javascript


1.25- 
today I built on my knowledge of using functions with booleans. I need to do a lot of styling as well as to get more trivia questions to pop up for the categories. 
I can do that tomorrow. Math.random()
I also need to add a start over function that will reset the game when all the questions are answered. 
Also storing the highest score in the app, 
eventually creating a score board so that the user can return to it.
